            * The Abstraction Gap

 (.n_n)._/ -> ....................... -> Interpret
           |<== the abstraction gap ==>|

 <- better UX                better performance ->

  * Bigger abstraction gap = more translation
  * Bigger abstraction gap = more runtime support


  Core tradeoff:
    * High-level features
    * Fast interpretation
    * Slim runtime support
