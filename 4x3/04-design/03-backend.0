==== (-n_n)- LET'S DESIGN A LANGUAGE! -(n_n-) =====
          * Backend: the "computer" part

 Things to try:

  - See if you can start with something *easy*

  - Or at least, decide upfront how ambitious
    you want to be

  - Try to limit the language's access to
    primitive features at first so you can swap
    out backends easily

  - Get the "big picture" performance stuff right
