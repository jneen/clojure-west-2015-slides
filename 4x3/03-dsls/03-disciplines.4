     Disciplines for Data Driven Architecture

    * If data is persisted, what is the
      migration strategy?

    * Who provides the data? How is it composed?
      How is it stored?

    * Is the data intended for humans or is it
      generated by machines?

    * What behaviors/resources do you want the
      data to specify?
