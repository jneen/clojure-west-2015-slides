                      * the middle parts

    * Goals:
      + Validate the code (if applicable)
      + Get your code from syntax to target.

    * "Whatever it takes"

    * Main strategy is core/match destructuring

    * Don't shy away from using mutable structures

    * Introduce IRs everywhere!

    * Continuously loop back to design.
