             Disciplines for Data Driven Architecture

    * If data is persisted, how important is back-compatibility?
      Can you migrate? (2to3)

    * Who provides the data? How is it composed? How is it stored?

    * Is the data intended for humans or is it generated by
      machines?

    * What behaviors/resources do you want the data to specify?

    * What behaviors/resources do you want to exclude?
