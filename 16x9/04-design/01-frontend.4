                  * Frontend: The "human" part

  ??? Questions ???

  - how will users store, write, update, and run code?

  - what kinds of errors can happen, and how will they be reported?

  - how much power do your users need? how much reliability?

  - what will your users expect to be *easy*?
    what will they be okay with being *difficult*?
